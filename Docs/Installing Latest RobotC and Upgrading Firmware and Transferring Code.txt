Steps for starting from scratch:

1. Install ROBOTC, activate license
2. Install VEX Programming Driver, Prolific USB-Serial driver, and then reinstall both in that order
3. Restart. 
4. Connect USB stuff with ROBOTC closed, wait for windows to detect it
5. open robotc
6. set communications port to usb wired cable #1, set platform to vex cortex 2.0
7. connect battery, turn on
8. master cpu firmware download
9. restart robotc, cortex
10. select port "com6"
11. transfer robotc firmware
12. compile & download prototypevexnet.c - it will ask for power cycling
13. power cycle cortex
14. compile & download
15. connect joystick to computer, detect communication ports, set communication port to usb wired cable #1, click ok in detailed preferences window, transfer vexnet firmware (joystick is off this whole time) - this should fail. then turn joystick on, trasnfer vexnet firmware again - this should work.
16. pair joystick and cortex
	connect with USB cable
	turn on joystick
	then turn on cortex
	then turn off in reverse order, disconnect
17. compile and download robotc vex default code - with download method set to usb&vexnet this time
18. stuff should work.
19. the battery died here, so we called it a day.
